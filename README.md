# DESCRIPTION OF TASK #
# TASK 1 : File-Handling-Utility #

The File Handling Utility is a Java-based project that demonstrates the practical use of file management operations through Java’s Input/Output (I/O) package. In today’s digital world, working with files is an essential requirement for almost every application, whether it is a desktop program, web application, or enterprise software. This project provides a simple yet effective approach to handling files in Java and showcases how different file-related operations can be implemented in a structured way.

The project primarily focuses on performing core file operations such as creating a new file, reading file content, writing data to a file, appending additional data, copying files from one location to another, and searching for specific content within files. These operations cover the most common use cases encountered in file management. Through this utility, users can understand how file handling works at a fundamental level and gain confidence in using Java’s file I/O classes.

The project is divided into different modules where each module performs a specific operation. For example, the file creation module allows the user to create a new file with a given name, while the reading module reads the contents of the file and displays it to the user. Similarly, the writing and appending modules allow the user to add new content to the file. The delete module ensures proper file removal when needed, and the search module scans the file for specific words or phrases. By dividing the project into these smaller tasks, it becomes easier to understand, implement, and maintain.

This project not only emphasizes coding skills but also improves logical thinking and problem-solving ability. It provides practical exposure to working with file systems, handling real-time exceptions, and ensuring data integrity. Moreover, it demonstrates how reusable methods can be designed for different file operations, which enhances the overall reusability and modularity of the code.
